# UC3 – Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)

## Description
Refactors UC1 and UC2 by replacing separate Feet and Inches classes with a single generic `QuantityLength` class.

Eliminates code duplication and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle while preserving all previous functionality.

## Objective
- Support equality comparison across units (Feet, Inches)
- Convert values to a common base unit (feet)
- Maintain clean, scalable, and maintainable design

## Implementation
- `LengthUnit` enum with conversion factors
- `QuantityLength` class with:
  - `private final double value`
  - `private final LengthUnit unit`
- Conversion to base unit before comparison
- Overridden `equals()` using `Double.compare()`
- Null and type safety checks

## Example

Input:
Quantity(1.0, FEET) and Quantity(12.0, INCH)

Output:
Equal: true

Input:
Quantity(1.0, INCH) and Quantity(1.0, INCH)

Output:
Equal: true

## Concepts Covered
- DRY Principle
- Enum Usage
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Equality Contract
- Cross-Unit Comparison
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Scalable Design

## Benefits Over UC1 & UC2
- No duplicated code
- Centralized conversion logic
- Easier to add new units
- Improved maintainability
- Backward compatibility preserved
