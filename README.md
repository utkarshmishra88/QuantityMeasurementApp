# UC4 – Extended Unit Support

## Description
Extends UC3 by adding **YARDS** and **CENTIMETERS** to the generic `QuantityLength` class.

Demonstrates scalability of the DRY-based design.  
New units are added only in the `LengthUnit` enum without modifying the main class logic.

## Objective
- Support equality across FEET, INCHES, YARDS, and CENTIMETERS
- Convert all values to a common base unit before comparison
- Maintain backward compatibility (UC1–UC3)

## Implementation
- Updated `LengthUnit` enum:
  - FEET
  - INCHES
  - YARDS (1 yard = 3 feet)
  - CENTIMETERS (1 cm = 0.393701 inches)
- No changes required in `QuantityLength` class
- Centralized conversion logic
- Overridden `equals()` using `Double.compare()`

## Example

Input:
Quantity(1.0, YARDS) and Quantity(3.0, FEET)  
Output:
Equal: true  

Input:
Quantity(1.0, YARDS) and Quantity(36.0, INCHES)  
Output:
Equal: true  

Input:
Quantity(1.0, CENTIMETERS) and Quantity(0.393701, INCHES)  
Output:
Equal: true
