# UC8 – Refactoring Unit Enum to Standalone with Conversion Responsibility

## Description
Refactors the architecture from UC1–UC7 by extracting `LengthUnit` into a standalone top-level enum.

Conversion responsibility is moved entirely to `LengthUnit`, while `QuantityLength` focuses only on value comparison and arithmetic operations.

This improves cohesion, reduces coupling, eliminates circular dependency risk, and establishes a scalable design pattern for future measurement categories.

## Architectural Change

Before:
LengthUnit embedded inside QuantityLength  
Conversion logic partially handled in QuantityLength  

After:
LengthUnit → Standalone enum  
Handles:
- convertToBaseUnit(double)
- convertFromBaseUnit(double)

QuantityLength:
- Delegates conversion to unit
- Handles equality and arithmetic only

## Responsibilities

### LengthUnit
- Stores conversion factor relative to base unit (FEET)
- Converts value → base unit
- Converts base unit → specific unit
- Immutable and thread-safe

### QuantityLength
- Holds value + LengthUnit
- Delegates conversions to unit
- Implements equals(), convertTo(), add()
- Maintains immutability

## Example

Quantity(1.0, FEET).convertTo(INCHES)  
→ Quantity(12.0, INCHES)

Quantity(36.0, INCHES).equals(Quantity(1.0, YARDS))  
→ true

LengthUnit.INCHES.convertToBaseUnit(12.0)  
→ 1.0

## Benefits

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Separation of Concerns
- Delegation Pattern
- High Cohesion
- Low Coupling
- Circular Dependency Elimination
- Backward Compatibility (UC1–UC7 preserved)
- Scalable for WeightUnit, VolumeUnit, etc.
- Centralized conversion logic
- Clean enterprise-ready architecture

## Validation

- All UC1–UC7 test cases pass unchanged
- Equality, conversion, and addition behave identically
- Round-trip conversions maintain precision (within epsilon)
- Null and invalid inputs properly validated

## Scalability Pattern

New measurement categories can follow the same pattern:

- Create standalone Unit enum (e.g., WeightUnit)
- Create corresponding Quantity class
- Delegate conversion responsibility to unit
- Keep quantity focused on arithmetic and comparison

Architecture now supports multi-category measurement systems without refactoring existing code.
