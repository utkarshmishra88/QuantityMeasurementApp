# UC2 – Feet and Inches Measurement Equality

## Description
Extends UC1 by adding equality comparison for Inches along with Feet.
Both measurements are treated separately and compared independently.

## Objective
Return:
- `true` if two Feet values are equal
- `true` if two Inches values are equal
- `false` otherwise

## Implementation
- Separate `Feet` and `Inches` classes
- Encapsulated `private final double value`
- Immutable design
- Overridden `equals()` using `Double.compare()`
- Null and type safety checks
- Separate static methods for Feet and Inches comparison

## Example

Input:
1.0 inch and 1.0 inch  
Output:
Equal: true  

Input:
1.0 ft and 1.0 ft  
Output:
Equal: true

## Concepts Covered
- Object Equality Contract
- Floating-point comparison
- Null safety
- Type safety
- Encapsulation
- Unit testing best practices

## Limitation
Violates DRY principle since Feet and Inches classes contain duplicated logic.
A better design would use a generic `Quantity` class or unit parameter to reduce redundancy.
